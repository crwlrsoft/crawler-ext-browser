# Headless Browser Extension Package for the crwlr/crawler package

The crwlr/crawler package itself already allows loading pages using a headless browser ([see documentation](https://www.crwlr.software/packages/crawler/v1.5/the-crawler/loaders#using-a-headless-browser)). However, it doesn't handle more complex browser actions such as clicking elements on loaded pages or taking screenshots. This extension is here to fulfill those needs.
